### Slide 8

Objective: Provide concrete risk mitigation strategies that build confidence in Agentic AI implementation while addressing executive concerns.

Layout Composition:
The slide is a flex-col with a header sized to content and a main area that grows to fill remaining space. The main area is a grid with two rows in a auto 1fr proportion. The top row is a flex-row with three risk mitigation strategy cards (1fr 1fr 1fr). The bottom row is a grid with two columns in a 2fr 1fr ratio, where the left contains detailed mitigation approaches and the right contains a risk management framework.
