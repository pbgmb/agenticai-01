### Slide 7

Objective: Honestly address implementation barriers while positioning them as manageable challenges with clear solutions.

Layout Composition:
The slide is a flex-col with a header sized to content and a main area that grows to fill remaining space. The main area is a grid with two columns in a 1fr 1fr ratio. The left column contains challenge categories as a flex-col with stacked cards. The right column is a flex-col with implementation difficulty assessment and barrier-to-solution mapping.
