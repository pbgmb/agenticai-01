# Image Requirements Summary

Based on the presentation plan, the following images are required:

## Slide 1: Title Slide Background
- **Source**: Image Generation
- **Description**: Abstract technology network background with subtle AI brain neural pathways, dark blue gradient overlay, professional business aesthetic
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9
- **Purpose**: Provides professional technology background for hero title slide
- **Justification**: Provides essential visual context for the AI technology topic while maintaining professional business aesthetic

## Total Images Required: 1

The presentation primarily relies on text-based content, charts, and data visualizations rather than illustrative images. This aligns with the business/executive presentation format where information density and clarity are prioritized over decorative visuals.

The single background image for the title slide serves to:
1. Establish the technology context immediately
2. Create professional visual impact for the opening
3. Set the tone for a sophisticated, business-focused presentation

All other slides focus on data, insights, frameworks, and actionable information presented through well-structured text components, maintaining the executive briefing format requested.
